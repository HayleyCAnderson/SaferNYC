<h2>About SaferNYC</h2>

<p>SaferNYC visualizes recent car collisions in New York City
involving pedestrians and cyclists. It is an effort to
highlight the risks posed by cars and encourage increased
safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

<p>Pedestrian and cyclist safety is a major concern in New
York City, and this application serves to highlight the
severity of the problem. The city is working on this
problem through the Vision Zero initiative, which includes
policy efforts and a few mapping applications.</p>

<p>SaferNYC complements the <a href="http://www.nycvzv.info" title=
"Vision Zero View" target="_blank">Vision Zero View</a>
collision map that visualizes data slightly differently and
shows historical rather than recent data. Another notable map using
the same dataset is Andrew Hill's

<p>The dataset used for this project does not include information on
charges or convictions in any of the accidents reported, but it should
be mentioned that very few of these accidents likely resulted in
consequences for the driver. Although the city has made changes in
recent months,

pedestrian's or cyclist's death.</p>
