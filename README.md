==============

SaferNYC is being developed as Hayley Anderson's capstone project for the Fall 2014 Metis Ruby on Rails program. It uses data from [NYC OpenData](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/NYC-BigApps/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95?) and mapping technology from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

SaferNYC is intended to help improve pedestrian and cyclist safety in New York City by raising awareness about the prevalence of collisions and pointing out hotspots. It is currently available for viewing at [safer-nyc.herokuapp.com](http://safer-nyc.herokuapp.com) but will be moved once development is complete. Please check back for updates.
